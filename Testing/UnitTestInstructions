USING THE UNIT TESTING

The test code in this folder is designed to test the functionality of the php scripts. 
php scripts are called from the android client. The call from android is made using
the Retrofit API. As such it is assumed during such a test that the API is working
perfectly. 

Requirements:
To perform this test having a server to host the php scripts is required.
	The default is assumed to be a local server ran on the same machine
	as that of the emulator.
	To change the server location go to the WebService file and replace
	the BASE_URL.

	It is also assumed that the php scripts are placed such that the patch
	way is BASE_URL/script.php

The test can be ran through by launching the PhpUnitTest android app
There will be six buttons displayed on the app.
Each button will perform a test of one of the php scripts.
Any reponses from the scripts are printed to the Android Studio run log.
